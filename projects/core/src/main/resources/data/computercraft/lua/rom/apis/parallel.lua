--[[- A simple way to run several functions at once.

Functions are not actually executed simultaneously, but rather this API will
automatically switch between them whenever they yield (e.g. whenever they call
[`coroutine.yield`], or functions that call that - such as [`os.pullEvent`] - or
functions that call that, etc - basically, anything that causes the function
to "pause").

Each function executed in "parallel" gets its own copy of the event queue,
and so "event consuming" functions (again, mostly anything that causes the
script to pause - eg [`os.sleep`], [`rednet.receive`], most of the [`turtle`] API,
etc) can safely be used in one without affecting the event queue accessed by
the other.


> [!WARNING]
> When using this API, be careful to pass the functions you want to run in
> parallel, and _not_ the result of calling those functions.
>
> For instance, the following is correct:
>
> ```lua
> local function do_sleep() sleep(1) end
> parallel.waitForAny(do_sleep, rednet.receive)
> ```

> but the following is **NOT**:

> ```lua
> local function do_sleep() sleep(1) end
> parallel.waitForAny(do_sleep(), rednet.receive)
